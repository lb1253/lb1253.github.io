<h1>Hello!</h1>
<img style="max-width:100%; width:400px" src="assets/images/LucasBatt_Profile.jpg">
<br/><br/>

I'm Lucas.
<br/><br/>
I support independent media to solve their business challenges.
<br/><br/>
I spent over seven years working at the intersection of revenue + community + journalism at <a href="https://thebristolcable.org/about/" target="_blank">the Bristol Cable</a>, a community-owned cooperative newspaper. 
<br/><br/>
I know what it takes to build a media organisation doing things differently. I worked across almost every organisational function, from leading on fundraising and membership, to HR and operations (with a bit of investigative data journalism thrown in), raising hundreds of thousands of pounds for the organisation.
<br/><br/>
A significant focus of my work was on nurturing a relationship with the Cable's 2,800 members and developing membership into a sustainable business model: developing membership growth strategies, newsletter products, facilitating community events and online participation, and delivering communications campaigns.
<br/><br/>
Since then I have been working to share what I learned about running and growing an innovative independent media organisation with others doing the same, both as a freelance consultant and as the coordinator of <a href="https://referencecircle.eu/" target="_blank">Reference</a> â€“ a network of pioneering European independent media organisations.
<br/><br/>
Whether you're from a newsroom looking to evolve your organisation, develop your membership programme, better understand and engage your community, and grow your revenue, or a non-profit seeking to support public interest journalism, I'm happy to help.
