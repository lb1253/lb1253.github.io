<h1>Hello!</h1>
<img style="max-width:100%; width:400px" src="assets/images/lbatt.jpg">


<br/><br/>

I'm Lucas.
<br/><br/>
I support independent media to solve their business challenges.
<br/><br/>
I coordinate <a href="https://referencecircle.eu/" target="_blank">Reference â€“ the European Independent Media Circle</a>. Before that, I spent 7.5 years working at the intersection of revenue + community + journalism at <a href="https://thebristolcable.org/about/" target="_blank">the Bristol Cable</a>.
<br/><br/>
There I worked across almost every organisational function, from fundraising and membership, to HR and operations. Much of my work focused on engaging members and developing membership into a sustainable business model: from developing strategies to grow membership, to facilitating community participation, and delivering communications campaigns.
<br/><br/>
I'm open to freelance work. Whether you're from a newsroom and wants to evolve your organisation, develop your membership programme, deepen community engagement, understand your audience and grow your revenue, or a non-profit seeking to support public interest journalism, I'm happy to help.
<br/><br/>
