<h1>Hello!</h1>

<br/><br/>

I'm Lucas.
<br/><br/>
I support independent media to solve their business challenges.
<br/><br/>
I spent 7.5 years working at the intersection of revenue + community + journalism at <a href="https://thebristolcable.org/about/" target="_blank">the Bristol Cable</a>. There I worked across almost every organisational function, from fundraising and membership, to HR and operations. Much of my work focused on engaging members and developing membership into a sustainable business model: from developing strategies to grow membership, to facilitating community participation, and delivering communications campaigns.
<br/><br/>
Since then I have supported independent media organisations to advance their missions, both as a freelance consultant and as the coordinator of <a href="https://referencecircle.eu/" target="_blank">Reference â€“ a network of pioneering European independent media</a>.
<br/><br/>
Whether you're from a newsroom looking to evolve your organisation, develop your membership programme, better understand and engage your communinity, and grow your revenue, or a non-profit seeking to support public interest journalism, I'm happy to help.
