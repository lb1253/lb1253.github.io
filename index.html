<h1>Hello!</h1>

<br/><br/>

I'm Lucas.
<br/><br/>
I support independent media to solve their business challenges.
<br/><br/>
I coordinate <a href="https://referencecircle.eu/" target="_blank">Reference â€“ the European Independent Media Circle</a>. Before that, I  spent 7.5 years working at the intersection of revenue + community + journalism at <a href="https://thebristolcable.org/about/" target="_blank">the Bristol Cable</a>.
<br/><br/>
There I worked across almost every organisational function, from fundraising and membership, to HR and operations. My work mainly focused on engaging members and developing membership into a sustainable business model: from developing strategies to grow membership, to facilitating community participation, and delivering communications campaigns.
<br/><br/>
I'm open to freelance work. I'm keen to work with newsrooms who want to develop their membership programmes, deepen community engagement, and grow their revenue.
