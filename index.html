<h1>Hello!</h1>
<img style="max-width:100%; width:400px" src="assets/images/lbatt.jpg">


<br/><br/>

I'm Lucas.
<br/><br/>
I've spent the last 7.5 years working at the intersection of community + journalism at the Bristol Cable.
<br/><br/>
I have worked across almost every organisational function, from fundraising and membership, to HR and operations.
<br/><br/>
My work mainly focused on engaging members and developing membership into a sustainable business model: from developing strategies to grow membership, to facilitating community participation, and delivering communications campaigns.
<br/><br/>
I'm open to freelance work. I'm keen to work with newsrooms who want to develop their membership programmes, deepen community engagement, and grow their revenue.
